# üí´ About Me:
I'm Bekhruz, a Computer Science undergraduate student currently studying at the University of Manchester. I'm passionate about technology and how it can be used to solve real-world problems. My current focus is on enhancing my skills in Java and C++, as well as learning new languages like C, Haskell, and Python.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I've also worked on several interesting projects, including a Neural Style Transfer program that uses Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for image style transfer, and an Employee Management System web application using PHP, MySQL, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

I'm always looking for new opportunities to collaborate and learn, and I'm particularly interested in projects that challenge me and push me out of my comfort zone. If you're working on something cool and you think I could contribute, don't hesitate to reach out!

Aside from coding, I'm an avid reader and enjoy exploring new topics, from philosophy to politics. I'm also a big fan of sports, particularly football, and enjoy playing and watching games with friends.

If you have any questions about my CS journey or just want to chat about technology and its impact on society, feel free to reach out. And remember, two hours of planning can save weeks of codin
